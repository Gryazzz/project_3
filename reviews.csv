B01HN7ZGUQ,02 Apr 2018,real_reviewer,I like that there is no printing on these sheets.,5.0 ,"What can you really say about plastic sheets that cost about two bucks each? First, I wash them by hand and they lay flat, no curl. No problem sliding while cutting with the knife blade vertical, can't really think of a situation when the knife would be at a steep enough angle to cause the sheet to slide across the counter. Yes, the knife marks the plastic, but no through cuts yet. Really, come on, two bucks each...would it really be awful if they only lasted a few months? Biggest improvement would be an option to buy smaller sheets....I may order more and then cut them to my preferred size. Best aspect may be that there is no printing on these sheets...now my wife can't squawk that I am cutting veggies on the chicken sheet!",
