Project Description/Outline
Description:  Use DC area transportation data source to understand relationships between metro performance and the use of other modes of transportation. 
Approach:  
Collect data from available data sources: Metro rail/bus, for-hire vehicles, and bikes.
Process Data: Clean, organize, and characterize
Analyze Data:  Determine statistical relationships between Metro measures of performance and other modes of transportation
Make Observations based on the data analysis
Product:  Project Presentation
Research Questions to Answer
Does time of year impact demand for transportation resources?
Does metro performance impact the demand for other transportation resources? 
IS there a statistical evidence metro KPI can predict metro Ridership
What models
Linear regression by each KPI 
Linear regression taking multiple KPIs
Marc: Y = TCSI model:
Coefficients: TCSI
 Polynomial regression
 
Can one predict the availability of transportation resources based on metro past performance? 
If 2.a is YES than is there a statistical evidence metro KPI affects other transportation resources ridership
   What models
linear regression by season
Linear regression by each KPI
